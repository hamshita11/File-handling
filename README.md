# File-handling
Aim : To create a file and to sort the data entered by the user.

Description:
So far the operations using C program are done on a prompt / terminal which is not stored anywhere. But in the software industry, most of the programs are written to store the information fetched from the program. One such way is to store the fetched information in a file. Different operations that can be performed on a file are:

Creation of a new file (fopen with attributes as “a” or “a+” or “w” or “w++”)
Opening an existing file (fopen)
Reading from file (fscanf or fgetc)
Writing to a file (fprintf or fputs)
Moving to a specific location in a file (fseek, rewind)
Closing a file (fclose)
The text in the brackets denotes the functions used for performing those operations.
